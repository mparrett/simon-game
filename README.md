# Simon Game

Please visit the [game page](https://mparrett.github.io/simon-game/) to give it a shot!

## Gameplay

The game presents a sequence of colors that the player must memorize and repeat. Each successful repetition increases the sequence length and the player's score.

### Features

- **Dynamic Speed:** The speed of the color sequence playback increases as the game progresses, making it more challenging.
- **Scoring:** Your score is the length of the longest sequence you correctly recall. The game tracks your high score and average score over multiple games.
- **Game Limits:** You can play up to 10 games. Successfully recalling a sequence of 20 colors wins the game.
